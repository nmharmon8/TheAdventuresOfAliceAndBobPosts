# The Physics of Discus Throwing

For discus throwing all you need is classical physics. No need for relitivistic effects.

## Launch Angle

Either intutivly or from your classical physics class, you know that, 45 degrees is the optimal angle for maximizing distance. How do we arrive at this?

$D = V*T $

where:

- D - is distance
- V - horizontal speed
- T  - time in air

Therefor the larger V and T are the, larger the distance.

T is maximized when you spend all your effort to launch the discus strait up, but if you launch the disuces your horizantal volocity is 0. So $D = 0*T{max}$
