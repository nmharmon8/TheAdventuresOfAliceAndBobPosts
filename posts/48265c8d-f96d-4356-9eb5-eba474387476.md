# The Physics of Discus Throwing

For discus throwing all you need is classical physics. No need for relativistically effects.

## Launch Angle

Either intuitively or from your classical physics class, you know that, 45 degrees is the optimal angle for maximizing distance. How do we arrive at this?

$D=V_h*T$

where:

- D distance
- $V_h$ velocity in the horizontal direction
- T time in air

Therefor the larger $V$ and $T$ are the, greater the distance the discus will travel.

How would we maximized $T$ (time in air)? We put all are effort into overcoming gravity. Which means throwing the discus strait up.

We maximized the time in air, but at what cost? $V_h$ is 0. Which means $D=0*T_{max}$, $D=0$

Maximizing $T$ dose not work so what if we maximize $V_h$. Maximizing the speed in the horizontal direction, would mean we throw the discus strait out.

Now the discus slams into the ground almost admittedly. Given the discus is marked at where it first touches, this also is a poor strategy.



In order to find the optimal launch angle lets write the distance formula in terms of the angle. That will allow us to use calculus to solve for the maximum of the equation. The equation we are looking for is often called Projectile Motion.


How would we write this equation? 

Well lets assume the discus was thrown at a uniform velocity $V_0$ making an angle $\theta$ with the ground.

Remember the unit circle. $cos\theta$ is the x component of the angle $\theta$, while $sin\theta$ is the y component of the angle $\theta$.

$D(\theta)=V_h*\cos\theta*\frac{2V_h\sin\theta}{g}$

- $\theta$ launch angle
- $g$ gravity
