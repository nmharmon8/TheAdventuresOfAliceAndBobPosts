# The Physics of Discus Throwing

For discus throwing all you need is classical physics. No need for relativistically effects.

## Launch Angle

Either intuitively or from your classical physics class, you know that, 45 degrees is the optimal angle for maximizing distance. How do we arrive at this?

$D=V_h*T$

where:

- D distance
- $V_h$ velocity in the horizontal direction
- T time in air

Therefor the larger V and T are the, larger the distance.

T is maximized when you spend all your effort to launch the discus strait up, but if you launch the discus your horizontal volocity is 0. So $D=0*T_m$
