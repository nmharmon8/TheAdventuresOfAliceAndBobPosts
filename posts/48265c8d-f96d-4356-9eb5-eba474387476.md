# The Physics of Discus Throwing

For discus throwing all you need is classical physics. No need for relativistically effects.

## Launch Angle

Either intuitively or from your classical physics class, you know that, 45 degrees is the optimal angle for maximizing distance. How do we arrive at this?

$D=V_h*T$

where:

- D distance
- $V_h$ velocity in the horizontal direction
- T time in air

Therefor the larger $V$ and $T$ are the, greater the distance the discus will travel.

How would we maximized $T$ (time in air)? We put all are effort into overcoming gravity. Which means throwing the discus strait up.

We maximized the time in air, but at what cost? $V_h$ is 0. Which means $D=0*T_{max}$, $D=0$

Maximizing $T$ dose not work so what if we maximize $V_h$. Maximizing the speed in the horizontal direction, would mean we throw the discus strait out.

Now the discus slams into the ground almost admittedly. Given the discus is marked at where it first touches, this also is a poor strategy.



In order to find the optimal launch angle lets write the distance formula in terms of the angle. That will allow us to use calculus to solve for the maximum of the equation. The equation we are looking for is often called Projectile Motion.


How would we write this equation? Lets start with all the relevant variables:

- $a_x=0$ We will assume acceleration is zero. E.G assume no outside forces such as air resistance.
- $V_x=V_{0x}$ Given acceleration is zero the initial velocity in the horizontal direction will be constant.
- ${\Delta}x = V_{0x}*t$ The change in X is just the velocity in the horizontal * time.
- $a_y=-g$ The vertical acceleration is equal due to gravity.
- $V_y=V_{0y} - gt$ The speed in the vertical direction is just the initial speed adjusted by the acceleration due to gravity. 
- ${\Delta}y = (V_{0y}-\frac{1}{2}gt)*t=V_{0y}*t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$ The change in $y$ is just $V_y$ * time.

Given the terms written out like this, it is easy to see how to assemble the equation for horizontal distance. But we wanted to write the equation in terms of $\theta$. If we consult the unit circle we will see that we can express:

- $V_x=V_0cos\theta$
- $V_y=V_0sin\theta$

$cos\theta$ is the x component (1,0) of the $\theta$, while $sin\theta$ is the y component (1,0) of the $\theta$.

Therefor the change in x can be written as:
${\Delta}x = V_0cos\theta*t_{max}$

We know that $t_{max} is when the discus hits the ground $y=0$. Let solve for $t_{max}$ using the equations above.

$0 = V_{0y}*t_{max}-\frac{1}{2}gt_{max}^2$ 

solve for $t_{max}$ 

$t_{max} = 0, \frac{2V_0sin\theta}{g}$

We got two answers, but the first is the initial position

Now we can replace the $t_{max}$ and get:

${\Delta}x = V_0cos\theta*\frac{2V_0sin\theta}{g}=\frac{2V_0^2}{g}*cos\theta*sin\theta$

Now we have the equation that we wished to maximize. We can constrain the angle between $0<=\theta<=90$.

Now we just need to take the derivative and solve for 0. Just use the product rule.

$d'(\theta)=\frac{2V^2}{g}(-sin{\theta}sin\theta+cos{\theta}cos{\theta})$
$d'(\theta)=\frac{2V^2}{g}(-sin^2{\theta}+cos^2{\theta})$
$d'(\theta)=\frac{2V^2}{g}(-sin^2{\theta}+cos^2{\theta})=0$
$cos^2\theta=sin^2\theta$
$\frac{cos^2\theta}{cos^2\theta}=\frac{sin^2\theta}{cos^2\theta}$
$1=tan^2\theta$
$1=tan\theta$
$arctan1=0=45\circ$

Given some assumptions such as no air resistance. We have shown that $45\circ$ is the best angle for throwing a discus.
