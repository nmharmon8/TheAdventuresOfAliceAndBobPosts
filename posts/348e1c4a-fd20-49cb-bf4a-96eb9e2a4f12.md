# Basic Robotic Control with Neural Networks

Robotic control with neural networks quickly gets into the weeds of neural networks. One might say "how hard could it be to drive a robot with a neural network?" Lets find out!

First of we start by thinking about the data. When approaching machine learning design data is almost always the place to start. Robots can have any number of sensors. So we will just assume we have a robot with GPS, Camera, Lidar. The exact set of sensors is not all that important. Beyond the sensors the robot also has controls. The inputs that make it move,
