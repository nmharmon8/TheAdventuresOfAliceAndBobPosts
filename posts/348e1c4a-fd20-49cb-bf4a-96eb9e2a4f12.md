# Basic Robotic Control with Neural Networks Imitation Learning

Robotic control with neural networks quickly gets into the weeds of neural networks. One might say "how hard could it be to drive a robot with a neural network?" Lets find out!

First off we will start by thinking about the data. When approaching machine learning design, data is always the place to start. Robots can have any number of sensors. So we will just assume we have a robot with GPS, Camera, and LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The exact set of sensors is not all that important for this discussion. Beyond the sensors the robot also has controls. The inputs that make it move, which should be considered part of the data.

What do we wish to accomplish with the controlling of the robot? Give the huge variety in possible robotic designed let us once again assume that are robot is just a souped up RC car. And we just wish the robotic car to drive from point A to point B.

Now that we have a framework for discussion, we can begin to think about the design of the machine learning. The flow of data is fairly strait forward. We wish to transfor
