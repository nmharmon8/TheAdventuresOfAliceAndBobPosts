# Basic Robotic Control with Neural Networks

Robotic control with neural networks quickly gets into the weeds of neural networks. One might say "how hard could it be to drive a robot with a neural network?" Lets find out!

First of we start by thinking about the data. When approaching machine learning design data is almost always the place to start. Robots can have a variety of sencsors.
