The Adventures Of Alice And Bob Posts

The post currently are created using CMarkup. I am looking into moving from CMarkup into [Nota](https://nota-lang.org/).

Recommond, viewing method is to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the markdownlint(davidanson.vscode-markdownlint) extention for rending the CMarkup.

TODO:
* Add the image directory to this repo so all the content of a post can be rendered. 
* Make a better way to edit on mobile.
