- Water Quality and Availability
    - Point Source Pollution vs Diffuse Pollution
        - Farm land must be far from rivers
            - Fertilizer and pesticides run off 
    - Quantity of water vs consistency of having water (drought, flooding)
        - Chinese sponge cities
    - The project was first proposed in 1952 by **Mao Zedong** who concluded that “the south has plenty of water, the north much less. If possible, the north should borrow a little.” And the SNWD does exactly that — it diverts water from the South to the North along three routes: eastern, middle, and western.
    - South North water transfer china
- China Water Layout
    - North China Lacking water
    - South more water
    - North East has good water
    - Greatest is South West, Snow Glaciers. 
- Water Politics
    - Brahmaputra River, China vs India. 
        - A lot of the flows start in India so should not effect as much as some people say.

        - Flows through China, India, and Bangladesh. It is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th.

        - From the Tibetan Plateau the river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
        - Major Trade Route Between western China and Southeast Asia.
        - Extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids/waterfalls.
        - Dams are also disrupting the Mekong’s annual flooding cycle, which helps to re-fertilize farmland naturally by spreading nutrient-rich silt, besides opening giant fish nurseries.
        - China has the worlds largest Dam Three Gorges Dam
    - Weaponize Water

        - Finally, 85% of China’s coal reserves are in water scarce provinces; coal
mining is consumptive of water and highly polluting. As a final twist, most of
these coal reserves overlap with big agricultural bases.
        - Countrywide, agriculture consumes 62% of water, power/industry 22%, humans 14% and other use 2% (e.g. replenishment of lakes).
        - high voltage transmission of power over long distances to the developed eastern agricultural,
        - discount nuclear: it uses nearly as much water as coal
        - Beijing Mayor announced that the city’s population would not be allowed
to rise over 23 million, the first reason he gave was a lack of water.
        - April 2013 the head of the China Water Investment Company declared that prices needed to be raised “many times”, because “nothing else would work”, he was quickly silenced, the government fearing protests by the people. 
        - First announced in February 2013, the “Water Pollution Action Plan” took 27 months to produce (implementing it will take longer).
        - meat uses around 15 times more water per kilo than rice, which
is itself a heavy consumer of water (1,000-1,500 litres per kilo) compared to
wheat.
- Is China fixing the cost of power? 
- can nuclear power plant use sea water?
    - Fukushima disaster has shown the dangers
- Government fines where cheaper to pay then it was to be complaint.
- What happens when you have developed a system under improper intensives. Can you change the insensitive without causing collapses?
- China did change how they measured water quality, Some time for the worse other time for the better. Removing some lakes or adding more testing sites.
- To better understand the terminology of water quality used by the report, please refer to the following list:
    - Grade I: suitable for source water and national natural reserve
    - Grade II: suitable for domestic use (first rate), rare aquatic lives (and some other uses)
    - Grade III: suitable for domestic use (second rate) (and some other uses)
    - Grade IV: suitable for industrial use and entertainment use (without contact with human)
    - Grade V: suitable for agricultural use
    - Grade V+: not suitable for any use
