Water is a constraint on China, and a constraint on the world

Draft V2

If you are anything like me you have heard a lot of roomers about China having a water shortage. Yet never had the time to dig into the truth of the matter. After spending the last week reading research reports and exploring data, I believe China dose have a water problem, but what has been written in click bat arctics have is misleading (yea duh). Even the majority of the research reports that are publicly available are out of date. The picture you will get from reading the results returned by Google would lead you to believe that China is crumbling at the seams due to lack of water. The data, admittedly largely provided by China, dose not support imitate catastrophic collapse of China due to water sacristy. Rather, the data shows China's is being constrained by the sacristy of water and the constraint of water sacristy is not limited to China. 

**Outing the Water Problem in Chain**

China historically has been a poor steward of their water resources. In 2009 only 23% of the water in lakes and reservoirs suitable for domestic use, while 35% of the water was not even usable for industrialist uses [china water risk]. The incredible extent of the water pollution in China has been a compounding factor for China. 

Beyond water pollution China has a lot less fresh water resources relative to its size and population then the United States. The population of Chain is ~18% of the worlds population while they only have ~7% of the worlds fresh water resources. The water that China dose have in not well distributed across China. The majority of the water is located in the South, while the majority of the population in located in the North.  

Making matter even worse for China is the economic focus on exports and growth. China has held the mandate to be self sufficient in energy, food, and minerals, but they have exceeded self sufficiency in main areas. China is the worlds large exporter of many agriculture products: Wheat, Rice, Cotton, Lettuce, Green Beans , Potatoes, Spinach, Pumpkin, Squash, Sweet Potatoes, Pears Grapes, Peaches, Apples, Pork, Lamb, Goats, Ducks, and a whole lot more. In addition to agricultural products we are all very aware of how many of the physical goods we enjoy are created in China.

**China's Efforts Addressing the Water Problem**

Based off data provide by the National Bureau of Statistics of Chain and the CWR (China Water Risk) addressing pollution has been Chains greatest success. China has implement major policy changes to address the pollution of water. Both efforts focused on addressing the causes of population and cleaning up the already polluted water. China has built hundred of water treatment facility to clean up existing pollution. One of the largest pollutants is run of pesticides and fertilizers, so China has required farmers to create buffer zones bettween the crops and bodies of water. Many similarly drastic efforts have been implemented by China to address water pollution. The data below show success of the policies.

Grade I: suitable for source water and national natural reserve

Grade II: suitable for domestic use (first rate), rare aquatic lives (and some other uses)

Grade III: suitable for domestic use (second rate) (and some other uses)

Grade IV: suitable for industrial use and entertainment use (without contact with human)

Grade V: suitable for agricultural use

Grade V+: not suitable for any use

Lake, Reservoirs, River river basins have all had significant improvements in the pollution levels.

The groundwater has continued to deteriorate in quality even give then policy focused on reducing water pollution. 

How much dose addressing the water pollution help China with water scarcity? We can use the water quality metrics to adjust the water resources per capita numbers into good water per capita. Here we have China's water resources per capita. These number look great. Accepted definitions of water stress/scarcity and acute scarcity are respectively 1,700m3, 1,000m3, and 500m3per person per year for all uses, direct and indirect. Based off those messuers it looks pretty good, now lets consider the water resources adjusted for pollution.

Now we get very different picture of actual available water per capita. In 2011 water resources per capita were approaching actual scarcity. The clean up of the pollution has broth water resource from actual scarcity above water stress levels.

It is important to realize that this water is not actually located where it is needed, so for people living in the big Northern cities like Beijing they are still experiencing actual water scarcity. 

Speaking of water not being located where it is needed this is a good time to briefly bring up the South to North water diversion project. The South to North water diversion project was conceived in the 1952, after Mao said "Water in the south is abundant, water in the north scarce. If possible, it would be fine to borrow a little.". As Moa indicated, 80% of the water in China is located in the south while the greater part of the population lives in the north. Diverting water is extremely costly, by 2014 the project had already cost more then double what was initially expected and is yet to be finished. This project has dislocated tens of millions of people. If finished, 71 billion cubic meters of water would be diverted per year, this would account for the predicted water shortage until 2050. For more on the south to north water diversion checkout the [China Dialogue](https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/11762-vast-river-diversion-plan-afoot-in-western-china-2/#:~:text=The%20South%2Dto%2DNorth%20Water%20Diversion%20is%20both%20the%20most,Yellow%20and%20Yangtze%20river%20systems.).

Its not clear the South to North water diversion project was a good choice, but it demonstrate the extents that China is willing to go in order to solve the water problem.
