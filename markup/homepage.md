"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know."[`[1]`](#1)

"Professing themselves to be wise, they become fools"[`[2]`](#2)

"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."[`[3]`](#3)

Finally, but most importantly I believe in objective truth. I belive in the awnwser to the question "What is truth?"[[4]](#4).
